# To-do-list
A simple to-do list to keep track of the things a person is supposed to do on a given day. (Also includes a work list which can be accessed using '/work' route.)

Steps to run the application:

1. Initialize node using the command 'node init' on cd.
2. Download required packages: express,body-parser,nodemon,ejs.
3. Run the server on a port of your choice (3000 kept as default) using the command 'node app.js' or 'npm run serve' (for this you're gonna have to add the serve command in the package.json file).
4. The app should work just fine.
